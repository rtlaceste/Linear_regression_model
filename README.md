# Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a variety of machine learning algorithms from the sklearn library. More projects will be uploaded soon. Other libaries used: nltk, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib. I am planning on using the other ML models that I have not covered yet and eventually add in my deep learning/AI algorithms (in development).
