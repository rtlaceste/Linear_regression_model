# Machine Learning Models
This repository contains a variety of machine learning algorithms from the sklearn library as well as my techniques in cleaning data. More projects will be uploaded soon. Other libaries used: nltk, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib. I am planning on using the other ML models that I have not covered yet and adding them to this repository soon.
